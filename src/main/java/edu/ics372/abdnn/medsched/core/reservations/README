INTRODUCTION
We can have multiple people trying to make appointments at the same time. We can have race conditions. To prevent that
and assure appointments are created successfully we need to reserve an examroom, patient, provider, and period. If all
the resources cannot be acquired for booking an appointment the reservation is removed.
